# Unicode Line Length

Short line with ASCII only.

This line has CJK characters scattered among ASCII text to create a very long line: aaaaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb cccccccccccccccccccc ddddddddddddddddd eeeeeeeeeeeee ff.

This line uses repeated text with padding to intentionally exceed the maximum one hundred and twenty character line limit when measured by raw byte count for the MD013 rule.
